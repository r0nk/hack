detect things like novelty/reflections

With any stream, there's:
	input
	output
	input space
	output space
	information
	handler

	output space > output > information
	input space > handler > input

a sort of hacking lambda calculus, that maximizes information while minimizing queries

It really comes down to query selection

human queries can also work
