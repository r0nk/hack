Each stream is basically its own program

we want to have a clean, systematic, fast way of creating these programs.

These streams can repeat at different parts of the tree.

These are different from raw binary checks, because often times we gain information from these.

trigger management for different streams.

use the filesystem to represent the stream tree

detect things like novelty/reflections

With any stream, there's:
	input
	output
	input space
	output space
	information
	handler

	output space > output > information
	input space > handler > input

we need a handler that selects other handlers

single universal handler per stream

hack will fork itself for every directory, recursively

a sort of hacking lambda calculus, that maximizes information while minimizing queries

It really comes down to query selection

human queries can also work
